## Ask Claude

This directory is designed to work with Claude. When you have questions:

1. Open this directory in Claude Code
2. Ask your question — Claude will read AGENTS.md and understand your system
3. Claude can help with: troubleshooting, process questions, system evolution, adding new things

Example questions:
- "How should I handle a new client project?"
- "I haven't done a weekly review in 3 weeks, how do I catch up?"
- "Should I create a tag for X?"
- "I'm feeling overwhelmed, what should I do?"
