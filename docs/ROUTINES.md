# Routines

Your daily and weekly rhythms. These are habits, not rules — missing one isn't failure.

## Daily Rhythm

### Morning Planning (10-15 min)

**Purpose:** Set yourself up for a successful day

1. Check calendar — What's blocked?
2. Open Daily Review perspective — Check external systems (backlogs, email, GitHub)
3. Open Today perspective — What's due or planned?
4. Flag 3-5 tasks — Realistic daily targets
5. Glance at Popcorn — Prime yourself for movement and chores

**Key question:** "If I only did these flagged tasks, would today be a success?"

### Throughout the Day

- Work from flagged tasks
- Check Popcorn between tasks (movement, chores)
- When stuck → Quick Wins or Context Switch perspective
- Capture new things to Inbox (don't process now)

### End of Day Shutdown (5 min)

**Purpose:** Close loops and prep for tomorrow

1. Process inbox to zero
2. Review flagged items — What happened?
3. Check tomorrow's calendar — Any prep needed?

**Key question:** "Can I mentally let go of work now?"

## Weekly Rhythm

### Weekly Review (30-45 min)

**When:** Sunday evening or Monday morning — pick one, protect it

**Purpose:** System maintenance and forward planning

1. Get inbox to zero
2. Review each project:
   - Clear next action?
   - Still relevant?
   - Deadlines approaching?
3. Review calendar (next 2 weeks)
5. Review Popcorn tasks
6. Celebrate completions

**Key question:** "Do I trust this system contains everything I need to do?"

See [RECIPES.md → Weekly Review](RECIPES.md#weekly-review) for detailed steps.

### Alternative: Popcorn-Style Reviews

If dedicated review blocks get deprioritized (Sunday nights with kids, Monday mornings with meetings), you can distribute project reviews throughout the week using the Popcorn approach:

1. Use OmniFocus's built-in Review feature (set review intervals per project)
2. Add "Review a project" to Popcorn → System (repeating, defer 1 day)
3. When you pick it, open the Review perspective and review 1-3 projects
4. If nothing's due, glance at Review perspective to confirm and move on

This treats project reviews as a menu option rather than a calendar mandate. The *system* tracks what needs reviewing; you just chip away when you have a few minutes.

**Note:** Some weekly review tasks (inbox zero, calendar scan, big-picture check) still benefit from a dedicated block. This approach primarily distributes the project-by-project review work.

## Making Routines Stick

### The Review Problem

You know you should do reviews. You don't do them consistently. This is normal.

**Strategies that help:**

1. **Same time, same place** — Consistency builds habit
2. **Calendar block** — It's an appointment with yourself
3. **Body doubling** — Do it with someone nearby (even if they're doing their own thing)
4. **Shorter is better** — 20-minute review > skipped 60-minute review
5. **Reward** — Coffee, snack, or something pleasant during/after

### When You Miss a Routine

**Morning planning skipped?**
- Flag one task. Just one. Do that.
- Or open Quick Wins and do anything.

**Shutdown skipped?**
- Tomorrow's morning planning will catch it.
- Don't process inbox tonight — it's tomorrow's problem.

**Weekly review skipped?**
- Don't double up next week.
- Do a quick 15-minute "emergency review" instead.
- See [RECIPES.md → Catching Up](RECIPES.md#catching-up-after-missing-reviews)

## Calendar Integration

### What goes on calendar

- **Hard commitments** — Meetings, appointments, deadlines
- **Weekly Review** — Recurring 30-45 min block
- **Movement prompts** — 5-min "🏃 Movement?" between meetings
- **Focus time** — Optional: blocked time for deep work

### What stays in OmniFocus

- **All tasks** — Even if they have due dates
- **Project tracking** — What you're working on
- **Context for decisions** — Tags, perspectives

### The relationship

Calendar tells you **when**.
OmniFocus tells you **what**.

During a calendar block, open the relevant perspective (Work, Volunteer, Side Quests, Personal) and work from there.

## Energy Patterns

If you notice patterns in your energy, use them:

| Time | Energy | Best for |
|------|--------|----------|
| Morning | Usually higher | 🤔 Deep Work, hard tasks |
| After lunch | Often lower | 😎 Shallow tasks, admin |
| Late afternoon | Variable | Quick wins, meetings |
| Evening | Depends | Personal, volunteer, creative |

**But don't over-engineer this.** If you're ready to do deep work at 3pm, do deep work at 3pm.

## The Meta-Routine

Once a month (or when things feel off):

1. Is this system working?
2. What's friction?
3. What would make it easier?

Update the system if needed. Simpler is usually better.
