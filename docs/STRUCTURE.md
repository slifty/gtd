# System Structure

The current structure of your OmniFocus setup. Reference this when you need to remember what exists.

---

## Folders

```
📁 Clients        — Freelance/contract work
📁 Volunteer      — Elected/appointed roles, community involvement
📁 Personal       — Life, health, home, creative
📁 Business       — Bookkeeping and company admin
```

---

## Projects

All projects are **single-action lists** (tasks available simultaneously, not sequential).

### Clients

One project per client engagement. If you have sub-projects for a single client (e.g., multiple workstreams), keep them as separate projects — the relationship is clear from naming.

Example structure:
```
📁 Clients
   📋 Client A
   📋 Client B
   📋 Client C (Admin)      — if client has separate admin needs
   📋 Client C (Project X)  — workstream for same client
```

### Volunteer

One project per role or organization.

Example structure:
```
📁 Volunteer
   📋 Board Role
   📋 Community Organization
   📋 Committee Work
```

### Personal

Organize by life area, not by individual goal. Recurring life events (annual trips, holidays) live as recurring tasks with checklists in the notes — not as separate projects.

| Project | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Health & Body | Medical, fitness, wellness |
| House & Home | Maintenance, improvements, household |
| Family | Family activities, responsibilities |
| Creative Projects | Side projects, creative work |
| Hobbies | Music, art, other pursuits |

Example structure:
```
📁 Personal
   📋 Health & Body
      ◯ Schedule annual physical [repeat: yearly]
      ◯ Refill prescription
      ◯ Weekly Review [flagged, repeat: weekly]

      ◯ Book ferry for vacation
      ◯ Schedule family photos
      ◯ Plan kid's birthday party
   📋 Creative Projects
      ◯ Write blog post draft
      ◯ Research podcast equipment
   📋 Hobbies
      ◯ Practice guitar (30 min)

```

### Business

One project per company/entity you do books for.

Example structure:

   📋 Partner's Company (Books)
   📋 Side Business (Books)
```
