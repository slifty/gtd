# When You're Stuck

Protocols for overwhelm, paralysis, and those moments when you can't start.

---

## The Quick Wins Ladder

**When:** You're overwhelmed and can't start anything

### Steps

1. Open **Quick Wins** perspective
2. Pick literally anything — don't think, just pick
3. Do it
4. Notice: you're moving now
5. Pick another, or return to regular work

### Why it works

Starting is the hardest part. The task doesn't matter — momentum does. Once you're moving, you stay moving.

### If Quick Wins is empty

Add some tasks with ⚡ 5min tag:
- Send one email
- File one document
- Review one item
- Make one decision

## The Context Switch Protocol

**When:** You're stuck on a specific hard task

### Steps

1. Recognize: "I'm stuck on this."
2. Open **Context Switch** perspective (😎 Shallow tasks)
3. Pick something completely different
4. Do it
5. Return to the hard task later (or tomorrow)

### Why it works

Sometimes your brain needs a break from a specific problem. Switching to a different type of work lets the stuck problem process in the background while you stay productive.

### This is not procrastination

Procrastination is avoiding work by doing non-work. Context switching is doing *different* work. You're still moving forward, just on a different track.

## The Movement Break Protocol

**When:** You've been sitting too long, energy is low, brain feels foggy

### Steps

1. Open **Popcorn** perspective
2. Pick one Movement task
3. Do it (takes 2-5 minutes)
4. Return to work

### Movement tasks available

- 10 pushups
- 20 squats
- 5-minute stretch
- Walk around the block
- Plank for 60 seconds
- Standing desk toggle
- Take stairs
- Walk during next call
- 10 lunges each leg
- Shoulder rolls and neck stretches

### Why it works

Physical movement:
- Increases blood flow to brain
- Releases tension from sitting
- Creates a clean break between tasks
- Gives your mind a micro-rest

## The "Just One Thing" Protocol

**When:** Everything feels too big, list is overwhelming

### Steps

1. Close all perspectives
2. Ask: "What is ONE thing I could do right now?"
3. Write it on paper (not OmniFocus)
4. Do that one thing
5. Repeat

### Why it works

Sometimes the system itself feels like too much. Paper strips away all the structure. One thing is manageable.

### When to return to OmniFocus

When you've done a few things and feel momentum. Don't force it.

## The Body Doubling Protocol

**When:** You can't get started alone

### What is body doubling?

Having another person nearby while you work. They don't need to help — just be present.

### Options

- Work in same room as partner/family member
- Video call with friend (cameras on, both working)
- Coworking space or coffee shop
- Virtual coworking (Focusmate, Flow Club)

### How to use it

1. Identify someone willing to body double
2. Set a time: "Can we work together for an hour?"
3. Be in the same space (physical or virtual)
4. Work on your own things
5. The presence helps you stay on task

## The Mode Audit

**When:** You're stuck repeatedly, nothing seems to work

### Steps

1. Stop trying to force it
2. Ask: "What's my actual energy level right now?"
3. Match task to mode:

| Energy | Do this |
|--------|---------|
| High | 🤔 Deep Work tasks, hard problems |
| Medium | Normal tasks, flagged items |
| Low | 😎 Shallow tasks, admin |
| None | Rest. Seriously. |

### "None" is valid

If your energy is genuinely depleted, the answer isn't a productivity trick. It's rest. Close OmniFocus. Take a break. Come back later.

## The Nuclear Option

**When:** Nothing is working, system feels broken, you want to abandon everything

### Steps

1. Close OmniFocus
2. Get a piece of paper
3. Write the ONE most important thing you need to do this week
4. Do only that until it's done
5. Then, and only then, return to the system

### After the crisis

Once you've stabilized:
1. Do a [recovery review](RECIPES.md#catching-up-after-missing-reviews)
2. Ask: "What caused this?" (Overcommitment? Missed reviews? Life stuff?)
3. Adjust if needed, but don't over-engineer

## Signs You Need Help Beyond Productivity Systems

If you're frequently experiencing:
- Inability to start tasks despite wanting to
- Persistent overwhelm that doesn't respond to these protocols
- Physical symptoms (racing heart, can't breathe, panic)
- Weeks going by without meaningful progress

This might not be a productivity problem. Consider talking to:
- A therapist (especially one familiar with ADHD)
- Your doctor
- A trusted friend or mentor

Productivity systems help with organization. They don't fix burnout, anxiety, depression, or unmanaged ADHD.

## Quick Reference Card

Post this somewhere visible:

```
STUCK? TRY THIS:

1. Quick Wins → Do anything small
2. Context Switch → Do something different
3. Popcorn → Move your body, do a quick chore
4. Just One Thing → Paper, one task, do it
5. Body Double → Work with someone nearby
6. Mode Audit → Match task to actual energy
7. Nuclear Option → One thing this week, ignore rest

"None" energy = rest, not productivity hacks
```
